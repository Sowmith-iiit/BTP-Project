    <h1>You're ready to use Parse!</h1>

    <p>Read the documentation and start building your JavaScript app:</p>

    <div style="display:none" class="error">
      Looks like there was a problem saving the test object. Make sure you've set your application ID and javascript key correctly in the call to <code>Parse.initialize</code> in this file.
    </div>

    <div style="display:none" class="success">
      <p>We've also just created your first object using the following code:</p>
      
        <code>
          var TestObject = Parse.Object.extend("TestObject");<br/>
          var testObject = new TestObject();<br/>
          testObject.save({foo: "bar"});
